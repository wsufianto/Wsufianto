<h3><<em>Hi there 👋</em></h3>
<hr>
I am Willy and currently undertaking Junior Web Developer Bootcamp with Generation Australia in partnership with Academy Xi. Love the course and super excited that I am nearing the end of the bootcamp and has the skills (HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript) to develope website now. I was in the real estate industry previously but found that my passion is in coding and decided to pursue it as a junior web developer. I am also learning REACT now and looking to learn more skills in the future.
